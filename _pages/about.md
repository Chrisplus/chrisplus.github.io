I am a Senior Researcher with Systems and Networking Research Group, [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in 2018, supervised by [Prof. Mo Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/limo/), and the Bachelor degree in computer engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). Before joining MSRA in 2019, I had also worked as a Senior Engineer at [Ant Lab](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/blockchain/).

My research interests broadly fall in edge computing, mobile sensing, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and wearables. My recent research mainly focuses on `Edge AI`, where I especially investigate the following topics: efficient inference system on Edge; continuous learning system for Edge; and AI-powered mobile sensing system.

I am constantly reruiting research interns. If you are interested in our work, please feel free to contact me.
