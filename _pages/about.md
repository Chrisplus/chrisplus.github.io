I am a Senior Researcher with [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in 2018, supervised by [Prof. Mo Li](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~lim/), and the Bachelor degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 


My research interests broadly fall in edge computing, mobile systems and AIoT. My recent research mainly focuses on `Edge AI`, where I especially investigate the following topics: efficient inference systems on Edge; LLM-powered agents for edge ecosystems; and AI-powered mobile sensing systems.

I am constantly reruiting research interns. If you are interested in our work, please feel free to contact me.
